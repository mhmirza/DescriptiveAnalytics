# DescriptiveAnalytics

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Exploring and Visualizing Data**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2022. The work done here involves statistical exploration, detailed visualization of data, and model fitting.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Programming in R for Analytics, I wish to learn how to use RStudio, read R documentation, and write R scripts. Moreover, I hope to gain an understanding of how to use R for production of graphics and data manipulation such as filtering, aggregating etc. I plan to learn how transformations, model fits, and residuals can be used to explore and check statistical assumptions about data. Finally, I wish to gain insights into how techniques such as simulation can be used to explore questions of model fit and statistical significance.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** The first part of the project focuses on manipulating data to identify and explore details of outliers in crime data. For example, detecting anomalies for block-week i.e. weeks for which crimes in a particular block (Possion Random Variable) were unusually high compared to the weekly average for that block. The second part of the project relies upon concepts from variable transformation, splines & cross-validation, and variable interactions. The final part draws upon individual creativity to use a movie related dataset for creating an insightful visualization.
