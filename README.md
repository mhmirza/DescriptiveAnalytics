# DescriptiveAnalytics

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Exploring and Visualizing Data**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2022. The work done here involves statistical exploration, detailed visualization of data, and model fitting.

# What I hope to learn?

From the course, Programming in R for Analytics, I wish to learn how to use RStudio, read R documentation, and write R scripts. Moreover, I hope to gain an understanding of how to use R for production of graphics and data manipulation such as filtering, aggregating etc. I plan to learn how transformations, model fits, and residuals can be used to explore and check statistical assumptions about data. Finally, I wish to gain insights into how techniques such as simulation can be used to explore questions of model fit and statistical significance.

# Final Project

**Brief Description:** "Sex-related differences: Is there a significant difference in income between men and women? Does the difference vary depending on other factors (e.g., education, marital status, criminal history, drug use, childhood household factors, profession, etc.)?"

The main question of interest was answered in the project through the following steps:

1) **Data processing and summarization:** Insightful graphical and tabular summaries of the data

2) **Methodology:** Dealing with missing values and topcoded variables; exploring trends and correlations; variable selection

3) **Findings:** Tabular summaries; graphical Summaries; regression and interpretation of coefficients; assessment of statistical significance

4) **Discussion:** Potential confounders; model fit limitations; confidence in results for policy makers
